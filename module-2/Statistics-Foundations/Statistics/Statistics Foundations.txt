Challenge 1

One player rolls two dices. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

    A. The values that the player obtains.
    B. The sum of the values obtained.
    C. The maximum value obtained after rolling both dices.
    
    
Solution: 
Considering for identical dices - 
The measurable space would be - there are 21 outcomes of it
(1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,6)
(1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,6)
(1,3) (2,4) (3,5) (4,6) 
(1,4) (2,5) (3,6)
(1,5) (2,6)
(1,6)

The values that the player obtains: I have considered the (1,2) or (2,1) as same because these are identical dices wouldn't matter the order how they rolled.
(1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (6,6)
(1,2) (2,3) (3,4) (4,5) (5,6)
(1,3) (2,4) (3,5) (4,6) 
(1,4) (2,5) (3,6)
(1,5) (2,6)
(1,6)

The sum of the values obtained - 
sum of values obtained would be from the range of 2 to 12 that would be the minimum measurable space is (1,1) when it is added it gives us 2. The maximum measurable space is (6,6) which is 12.

The maximum value obtained after rolling both dices - 
would be 12 where (6,6)  is the maximum in our measurable space.



Describe the following events:

    Case A: Both values are greater than 5.-
    Looking from the measurable space we can see only (6,6) are the greater values from 5
    
    Case B: The sum of values is even. - 
    I'm considering [(1,1),(1,3),(1,5),(2,2),(2,4),(2,6),(3,3),(3,5),(4,4),(4,6),(5,5),(6,6)] there are 12 outcomes which has the values as even 
    
    Case C: The maximum is the value of both rolls. - 
    so the maximum dice value would be (6,6)
    
    
 

Challenge 2

One player picks two cards from a poker deck. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
The measurable space is: 52 Outcomes
(A spades) (A clubs) (A heart) (A diamonds)
(2 spades) (2 clubs) (2 heart) (2 diamonds)
(3 spades) (3 clubs) (3 heart) (3 diamonds)
(4 spades) (4 clubs) (4 heart) (4 diamonds)
(5 spades) (5 clubs) (5 heart) (5 diamonds)
(6 spades) (6 clubs) (6 heart) (6 diamonds)
(7 spades) (7 clubs) (7 heart) (7 diamonds)
(8 spades) (8 clubs) (8 heart) (8 diamonds)
(9 spades) (9 clubs) (9 heart) (9 diamonds) 
(10 spades) (10 clubs) (10 heart) (10 diamonds)
(J spades) (J clubs) (J heart) (J diamonds)
(Q spades) (Q clubs) (Q heart) (Q diamonds)
(K spades) (K clubs) (K heart) (K diamonds)

    A. The number of figures he picks. - 
    if the first card is a figure so he have a probabilty of 12/52 and the second card is also a figure then it is 11 / 52.
    But if the first card is figure so he have 12/52 and the second card is non face cards then he has a probability of 40/ 52.
    
    B. The sum of card values. Consider that the value of figures is 10 and the value of aces is 15.
    If two cards are the figures then the sum is 20
    If the first card is figure and second is  not then the sum would be te value of the number plus the figure which is 10.
    But if the second card is Aces then it would be 15 + 10 = 25
    
    C. The number of hearts or spades he picks. 
    Considering two cases in this - if the first card is a heart is 13/52 chances and second card if its a spade is 13/52 



Describe the following events:

    Case A: The number of figures in the cards the player picked is two. - 
    [(K,K), (K,Q), (K,J), (Q,K), (Q,Q), (Q,J), (J,K), (J,Q), (J,J)]
    
    Case B: The sum of card values is 17. - 
    [(J + 7), (Q + 7), (K + 7), (A + 2), (10 + 7), (9 + 8)], so there are 6 chances 
    
    Case C: The value of both cards is less than 8. 
    [(2 + 3), (2 + 4), (2 + 5), (3 + 3), (3 + 4)] , so there are 5 chances.



Challenge 3

Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

    A. The score of player A. - 
    it can be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6
    
    B. The greatest score. -  
    6 would be the greatest score
    
    C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
    "The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.".
    If A has the max score than B then he gets 1 coin 
    example[(6,5),(6,4),(6,3),(6,2),(6,1),(5,4),(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(4,3),(4,2),(4,1),(3,2),(3,1),(2,1)] = 15 chances
    
    
    D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
    "The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.".
    If A has the max score then he gets the difference bewteen them
    example[(6,5) = 6 - 5 = 1], [(6, 1) = 6 - 1 = 5]



Describe the following events:

    Case A: The score of player A is 2. - So the face of the dice of A has to be 2.
    ex = [(2,1),(2,2)] = 6 outcomes
    
    Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.
    The sum of 2 faces should be less than or equal to 2
    [(1,1)]
    
    
    Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe:
        Player A wins at least 4 coins. 
        [6,5),(6,4),(6,3),(6,2)]
        
        Player A loses more than 2 coins.
        [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]
        
        Player A neither wins nor loses coins.
        [(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6)] = 6 outcomes
