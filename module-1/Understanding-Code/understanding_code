Positives:
* Great usage of functions - Creating different functions and calling them inside the main function.
* Using Comments - Well explained the functionality of a module by using comments.
* Used regular expressions and list comprehension 

Can Improve:
* usage of variable names - used char 'l' in a for loop which is looking like a number 1.
* Internally given a hardcoded number for a function which I got confused which can be explained in comments.
